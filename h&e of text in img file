Hiding and extracting a text file behind an image file.

Aim of the Experiment:
To study the steps for hiding and extract any text file behind an image file using Command Prompt. 
Any file like .rar .jpg .txt or any file can be merged inside another file. In a simple way, we shall learn how to hide a text file inside an image file using the Command Prompt. 
How to Hide the FILE? 
Suppose you have to hide a text file “A.txt” with the image file “B.jpg” and combine them in a new file as “C.jpg”.  Where “C.jpg” is our output file which contains the text hidden in the image file. 
Follow the steps: 
copy the file need to hide, to desktop (for our tutorial let us assume the file to be "A.txt")
copy the image, within which you need to hide the file, to desktop (let it be "B.jpg")
now open the cmd: >ctrl+r >type: cmd and hit enter 
in cmd first type the code as follows: >cd desktop NOTE: this code is for assigning the location on cmd to desktop 
Now type the following code: 

                   copy /b B.jpg + A.txt C.jpg
 Syntax: copy /b Name-of-file-containing-text-you-want-to-hide.txt + Name-of-initial- image.jpg Resulting-image-name.jpg 

"C.jpg" is the output image inside this out image our file is hidden 

How to retrieve the file? 
locate C.jpg file from where you want to retrieve text data 
Right-click and open with notepad
 

Done! Successfully opened! In the last of the notepad, you’ll find the content of the text file.
