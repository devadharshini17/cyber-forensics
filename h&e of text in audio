Hiding and extracting a text file behind an audio file.
Aim of the Experiment:
To study the steps for hiding and extract any text file behind an Audio file using Command Prompt. 
Any file like .rar .jpg .txt or any file can be merged inside another file. In a simple way, we shall learn how to hide a text file inside an image file using the Command Prompt. 
How to Hide the FILE? 
Suppose you have to hide a text file “A.txt” with the image file “sound.mp3” and combine them in a new file as “newfile.mp3”.  Where “newfile.mp3” is our output file which contains the text hidden in the image file. 
Follow the steps: 
copy the file need to hide, to desktop (for our tutorial let us assume the file to be "A.txt")
copy the audio, within which you need to hide the file, to desktop (let it be "sound.mp3")
now open the cmd: >ctrl+r >type: cmd and hit enter 
in cmd first type the code as follows: >cd desktop NOTE: this code is for assigning the location on cmd to desktop 
Now type the following code: 

      copy /b A.txt + sound.mp3 newfile.mp3
 Syntax: copy /b Name-of-file-containing-text-you-want-to-hide.txt + Name-of-initial- audio.mp3 Resulting-audio-name.mp3 

"newfile.mp3" is the output audio inside this out audio our file is hidden 

How to retrieve the file? 
locate newfile.mp3 file from where you want to retrieve text data 
Right-click and open with notepad
 

Done! Successfully opened! In the last of the notepad, you’ll find the content of the text file. 
Hide A Message into Audio:
Open the Run command window by pressing win + r. 
Open command prompt by typing cmd and press OK 
Enter the directory where you have your files. 
Then type the command: echo "Your Message">>"audio.mp3"
Now the message is successfully hidden in the audio file.
To view the message: Open with Notepad, at last, you’ll find the Your Message
Result:
The experiment has been successfully executed.
